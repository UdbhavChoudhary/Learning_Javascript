# Learning_Javascript
I'm uploading the code I wrote while I follow a javascript tutorial
I'm following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg
Most of the code in the tutorial and what I have written is the same. I just wanted to follow along and write the code on my own. 
I'll keep uploading (albeit not regularly) as I learn more.
